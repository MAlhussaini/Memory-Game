## Instructions

## How I built the Memory Game

I manipulated the DOM with Vanilla JS, and also have altered part of the HTML and the style of the game.

- created a deck of cards that shuffles when game is refreshed
- created a counter to count the number of moves made by player and timer to know the duration of a play
- added effects to cards when they match and are unmatched
- create a pop-up modal when player wins game
